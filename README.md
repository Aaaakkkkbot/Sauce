Try it! [@SauceNAObot](https://t.me/SauceNAObot)

# Features

- Send an image to [@SauceNAObot](https://t.me/SauceNAObot) for saucenao search. You can also reply to a image with: /sauce, /source/, /saucenao, /sourcenow, /search, Sauce, sauce or a mention \([@SauceNAObot](https://t.me/SauceNAObot)\).

- Offers alternative search options when sauce is not found or when you use the /temp command.

- Personal search history using inline. Forward the multimedia you've searched along with the sauce to your groups or channels.

- Anti-Cheats. If your group has "guess the character" bots or similar bots, you can use SauceNAO's AntiCheats feature. This will prevent [@SauceNAObot](https://t.me/SauceNAObot) from performing reverse media searches sent by specific bots you specified. Reply to a bot with **/anticheats add** to add it to the AntiCheat List or reply **/anticheats remove** to remove it.
